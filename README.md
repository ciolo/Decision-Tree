# Decision-Tree
Decision Tree Learning with *hyperparameter*.

# Requirements
Datasets must be in csv format and the labels must be in the last column. The first row of the file describes the attributes, and the description of label must contain the *class* script. All that because the datasets will be processed with Pandas and the description of the labels is used by Sklearn to calculate the accuracy.
